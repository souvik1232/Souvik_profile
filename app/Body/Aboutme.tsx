        <p>
          Hey, my name is Souvik, and I&apos;m a Fullstack Developer. My passion
          <br />
          is to create and develop a clean UI with a reliable backend for my
          users.
          <br />
          <br />
          My main stack currently includes Angular, React, and Next.js ‚Äî which I&apos;m
          actively working with. I use
          <br />
          Tailwind CSS and TypeScript, alongside Node.js for server-side
          <br />
          operations, and I utilize AWS and Azure for cloud services and
          <br />
          infrastructure.
